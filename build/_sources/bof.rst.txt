Birds of a Feather
==================

Birds of a Feather sessions (BoFs) are discussion about a particular topic within
a group of interested folks. BoFs are a new addition to PyCon India this year.

Birds of Feather would be a bit different from other conferences, since this year
we are planning to replace it with Open Spaces.

BoFs will be coordinated by the conference *BoF Team*.

Process
-------

The announcement of BoF would be on the opening session.

The entries for BoFs will be taken via Google Form that will be shared on
our communication channels (Hopin Chat, Zulip, Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin).

The entries would then slotted, and the respective person would be contacted to
provide them with the appropriate time. Adjustment would time would be a rare event.
Upon agreeing, the schedule will be updated both in Hopin, and Ical.

Both the conference days, there will be seperate forms to take in the entries
for BoFs.

Hopin Setup
-----------

The BoFs will be hosted on Hopin Sessions, **not** on any of the stages.


Further Information
-------------------

Subhendu Ghosh is the primary coordinator/point of contact for BoF.
