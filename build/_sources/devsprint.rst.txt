DevSprint
==================

PyCon India is a place for developers from across the country (and beyond) to get together and celebrate Python. But what good is a PyCon without getting your hands dirty writing some code? Hence, for all Open Source enthusiasts out there, the PyCon India team is happy to announce DevSprints @ PyCon India 2020.

During DevSprints, mentors/contributors of OSS projects guide participants through the end-to-end process of OSS contribution, right from setting up build environments, to developing and testing code, to submitting patches for bugs. If you are stuck, mentors are all available to help you figure out issues and get you back up and running! From past experiences, weâ€™ve seen a lot of people start off contributing to OSS through DevSprints and later go on to become regular contributors to various projects across the web.
