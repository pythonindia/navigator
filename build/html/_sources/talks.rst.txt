Talks and Keynotes
==================

PyCon India 2020 comprises of 36+ talks, and 6 keynotes. Since, the event is an
online event, the team decided to take it global and reach to a wider audience
which is impossible in a offline setting.

Schedule & Timing
-----------------

PyCon India 2020 team to accommodate an international audience tried to find a
time that suits speakers, or find a bit of overlap in their day.

The event starts at **12:00 noon IST** and ends at **8:00 PM IST**.

The `Schedule <https://in.pycon.org/2020/schedule/>`_ lists all the selected talks
which will be held within the core event time. It is possible that there would
be few events that would be held outside the event timings. The schedule on
the website contains just the talks, keynotes and the workshops.

Attendees when on the platform, Hopin can see a more detailed schedule which
would list the events happening on the platform, for example, BoFs, refusals.py
etc.

The team also provides with a Ical format for download and integrating with their
calendar client. The team will also try to keep the Ical format updated.
