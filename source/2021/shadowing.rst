Shadowing
=========

The shadow program is meant to be a way to mentor volunteers to take up the workgroup/conference chair role for the subsequent conference cycles.

The Shadow system is an apprenticeship model, like those used by union tradespeople.

When we shift back to a physical conference, the program will help mentor teams from the next conference organizing region.

How is it different than being a volunteer?
-------------------------------------------

Everyone contributing towards the organizing the conference is counted as a volunteer. Shadows are only different in the sense that they are expected
to devote more time to their workgroup as one of them is expected to be a workgroup for later conferences.

How do I become a shadow?
-------------------------

You can check the box that you want to be a shadow while filing the volunteer form. If you didn't select back then, but want to take up the role later on, please contact the respective workgroup lead.

What next after I shadow?
-------------------------

The usual path forward is to become the lead for the workgroup that you shadowed for. In case if you want explore a different workgroup, you can volunteer for that as well.

You can shadow once more as well, if you feel you want to continue with the workgroup but want to learn more before taking up the lead responsibility.
