As every online conference has unique setup, please read through this document as it will make the experience of everyone in PyCon India an eventful one.

Platforms in PyCon India
------------------------

- **Hopin**: This is the event platform, where the attendees will the be attending the talks, workshops, keynotes, etc.

So make sure you are available on the platform during the conference. Please follow the invitation link sent to you over email, to join the platform. It will automatically join you in the required streams (similar to channels in Slack). Send a message on `#2021/speaker-lounge <https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/2021.2Fspeaker-lounge>`_ stream once you are checked-in for the event.
- **StreamYard**: This platform is our Broadcast Studio i.e. all the speakers will be joining here to give the talk. The video stream from here will be relayed to Hopin platform. You need to be available **15 minutes** before your talk slot on the URL.
